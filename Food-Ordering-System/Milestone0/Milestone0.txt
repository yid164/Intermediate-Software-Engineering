Project Name: Study Planner

Idea: This is a study planner for all student. 

For: All University students

Main function: 

1. Automatically record the views of all courses, so it could advise what kind of courses that student should take (easy, mid, hard)

2. Automatically record the students' grades, then it could help student to choose classes and majors (e.g. when a student's major grade is too low, it could give the best major that he/she could change)

3. Helping students to schedule their course when they register their course. (It should have the function because I have to compare every courses' times in every term, and I have to organize every course that I take. PAWS sometimes is not intelligent)

4. It should have a calendar to automatic record all assignments (whatever the course in which major) or big things for students. (That why I love use CS moodle, but not all courses are in CS lol)
